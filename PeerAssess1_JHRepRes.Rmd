This is an R Markdown file, for the first peer assessment assignment in the John Hopkins Coursera MOOC, Reproducible Research.

This first R code reads in the raw data, displays the first six records and the final six records.

```{r}
rawActivity = read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
head(rawActivity)
tail(rawActivity)
```

Here is summary information for all three raw data variables:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(rawActivity)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
